Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis:

Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to understand the patterns and reasons behind booking cancellations. The dataset includes information on room preferences, customer segments (couples, families, singles), monthly booking trends, cancellations, and hotel types (city or resort). The goal is to identify insights and recommend strategies to reduce cancellations and improve booking retention.

Key Operations:
Data Cleaning: Removed null values and duplicates to ensure data accuracy.
Data Analysis: Used pivot tables to analyze cancellations by room types, customer segments, booking months, and hotel types.
Dashboard Creation: Built an interactive dashboard to visually represent the findings using bar charts, pie charts, and other visuals for easier interpretation.
Recommendations: Provided actionable insights, such as offering targeted promotions during peak cancellation months and creating special packages for customer segments with high cancellation rates.

Tools & Technologies:
Excel (Data cleaning, pivot tables, dashboard creation)
Data visualization (charts and graphs)

Purpose:
The analysis helps hotel management understand cancellation patterns and provides strategies to reduce cancellation rates, ultimately improving overall booking performance.
